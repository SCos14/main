# The primary objective of the Competitive Intelligence Report programming project was to leverage the novel Morningstar Direct Python Package to develop a report summarizing performance and pricing data relating to a select list of investment products in comparison to investments sharing the same Morningstar Category (Peer Group) across the Canadian Investment Universe. This report substantially streamlines the report generation process and replaces the need for expensive and cumbersome peer intelligence software, such as InvestorCOM. The Excel output, when paired with the VBA Code File, produces an organized and presentable competitive intelligence report equipped with a Table of Contents and Conditional Formatting.
